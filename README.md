# Diski
Computer Science House AR Disk Viewer

## What is This?
Diski is a website designed for mobile use to view the names on the signed disks in computer science house in AR. Many of our older Disks have faded with time and hopefully this project can help preserve those names.   

## Why am I doing this?
diski is my attempt at trying to learn web development. I have never touched web development in my four years at RIT/CSH and figured it was time to try it out.
The project itself is built off of AR.js, the AR web toolkit. The idea of this project is to learn web development in a platform that interacts with the world.
